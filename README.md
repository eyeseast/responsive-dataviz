# pig is a scrolling-based presentation inspired by [big](http://github.com/tmcw/big) and [stack](http://github.com/mbostock/stack)

It's a presentation system for real people. It's 0.7kb, supports keybindings,
simple browsers, permalinks, and so on.

## using it

    wget https://raw.github.com/tmcw/pig/gh-pages/pig.css -O pig.css
    wget https://raw.github.com/tmcw/pig/gh-pages/pig.js -O pig.js
    wget https://raw.github.com/tmcw/pig/gh-pages/index.html -O index.html

[Then, just boot up a local development server](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/4989751)

## how

pig just makes pages as tall as your browser so that one scroll-down equals
one page.

## plus

works great with [scrollchart](https://github.com/tmcw/scrollchart)
